Average Calculator:

Manages a library of students and their weekly averages.
Made to fit the Academy Grading System.

Why averages?

Students are graded daily from 5.0 - 10.0 in several areas (Program, Academics, Athletics, Family Representative, Psychotherapy, and Educational Groups). 

These daily averages are compiled into a weekly average which is recorded to track the student's progress. 

Depending on their averages, students may: participate in extra activities and be entitled to certain priveledges.

The purpose of the Average Calculator?

The Average Calculator is an application that can meet all of a user's needs when it comes to averages; this includes but is not limited to: adding and deleting students, updating daily averages, and compiling weekly averages in an easy to use environment.


Loading and Saving Data:

The Student Roster is saved under the file "names.txt" which is accessed and edited by the Average Calculator. "names.txt" is accessed upon initialization to build a local database of students and averages that can be manipulated by the application. 

Saved Averages --
The actual database of students and their corresponding averages is stored in the file "savedAverages.txt". Information is saved into this file under JSON format and is accessed when a user inputs the "LOAD" command.
